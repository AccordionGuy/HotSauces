## Introduction

This is the repository for the article ***Build and Secure an API with Spring Boot, Kotlin, and Auth0***. 

It’s made up of two separate projects, each in its own directory:

* **app**: The code for the project, which is an API implemented in Spring Boot and Kotlin that exposes a single resource: A catalog of hot sauces. The project’s structure uses Spring Initializr scaffolding and uses Gradle as its build tool.
* **article**: The article, which first shows the reader how to build an API with Spring Boot and Kotlin, and then walks them through the process of securing the API with Auth0. The article is written in Markdown.


## Requirements

In order to follow the steps to build this project, you'll need the following:

* **JDK 11**. This has been tested using both Oracle’s Java SE 11.0.8+10 and OpenJDK 11.0.8+10.
* **An internet connection,** as this project uses Gradle to download a number of dependencies, including those for Kotlin, Spring Boot, and OAuth2.
